## Discipline & Accountability

> Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments.

> “Accountability breeds ‘response-ability’.” - Stephen Covey

> “With great power comes great responsibility.” – Spider-Man… Well, the viceversa is also true. With great responsibility, you gain more power!

- The Brimma Tribe is responsible and accountable for what goes into the git repo. Every developer in the tribe needs to understand the needs and the importance of the workflow that is followed. 

- Just because some of the steps are painful, you should not skip it. Let’s figure out ways to automate the ‘painful’ steps rather than ignoring them.

> Developer testing is an important step towards accountability. It gives developers a way to demonstrate the quality of the software they produce. - Kent Beck

- Reviewing the code should be initiated and driven by the developer, who produced the code.

- Having different sets of git workflows based on projects and client necessity

- Ensuing that the PR/commit doesn’t break the build and deployment… and many more.

## Maintenance

> Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute - Donald Knuth, Turing Awardee

- Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.

- Code conventions improve the readability of the software. Thus, allowing engineers to understand new code quickly and thoroughly.

- Producing modular, readable, and maintainable code should be our goal.

- Producing proper comments while writing the code/committing the code should be our goal.

- Note: 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes towards maintenance.


Mostly, these pointers are better learnt on the job through peers rather than being taught in a classroom. These should be the principles that are passed on from tribe to a new tribe member.

I believe, principles drive culture and culture drives the values.
