# Customer collaboration over contract negotiation


### Son of Godzilla:

The four principles of agile seems to be like doing babysitting , and you will think  " Yeah I can manage it" , it looks easy,but once you start practicing it , you will realize that this baby is the son of Godzilla. Mastering agile requires lots of practice ,intelligence and many more.Customer collaboration is very important and it is hard to achieve it.Leadership team need to know the benefits of it and they should enable it.If they want their teams to be agile , they should be agile and give full support to their teams. So its always good to train the leadership team first.

### Frequent requirement change is a boon:

How many of us are tired of frequent requirement changes, one thing I learnt from my past experience is that we can't stop it and so I started to embrace the requirement changes & accepted it willingly . The outcome was worth it. In fact there is going to be so much of requirement changes once you start collaborating with the customer.
Your delivery model should be iterative and very frequent , may be once in two weeks, demo whats developed to the customer , get the feedback ,see if it is good.. bad ... need improvements , implement those changes in the next iteration and demo it again to the customer . This loop should not break until you are done with the project . Doing this way you don't need to worry about the user acceptance testing , you are going to come out of that phase unscathed.

### Col.Quaritch in avatar movie:

During my initial stages of my career , I worked in waterfall , project duration would be like 3 months and every quarter there will be a major release.
Every time the software gets into UAT phase , there would be so much of issues , the blame game will start and it used to be like a nightmare.

*Col.Quaritch:3 tours Nigeria, not a scratch.I come out here?Think I felt like a shavetail louie?*

I am a fan of avatar ,watched it so many times , bear with me :).           That's how it is, everything will be fine during integration testing , system testing -literally no scratches and in UAT it will be a mess. We will be beaten to death.

*Jeff in one of his books had mentioned  that OODA should be the Mindset of Scrum.*

*The phrase OODA loop refers to the decision cycle of observe, orient, decide, and act, developed by military strategist and USAF Colonel John Boyd. Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in military operations. - WIKI*

Most importantly automate this process else its going to be a pain, continuous delivery by Jez Humble is a good read.
