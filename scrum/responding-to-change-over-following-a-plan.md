# Responding to Change over Following a Plan

### *Software development planning boils down to these factors*

- Requirements
- Technology & Team Involved
- Capital
- Time to go live  

The requirements are going to change, customers will get better ideas 
on what they wanted once they start seeing the incrementally delivered product, 
so requirement change is going to be obvious.
More over the feature which may be of high priority today would be of
very less important tomorrow or it may even become obsolete.
The technology is evolving fastly,more importantly -
team’s strength which is impossible to gauge & competitors/competition
– we need to be fast in delivering.

From Thirukural aka 'Universal book of principles'

பொருள்கருவி காலம் வினையிடனொ டைந்தும்  
இருள்தீர எண்ணிச் செயல்

### Explanation
*Do an act after a due consideration of the (following) five, viz money, means, time, execution and place*

Thirukural is one of the most prominent literary works in Tamil, known for its excellent and timeless elucidation of ways and values of life. The work itself is one of the oldest works of literature known to man, authored around 2000 years ago. - (Quora)

The Latin translation of the Tirukkuṛaḷ was made byConstanzo Beschi in 1730.[citation needed] An English Translation of Thirukural by George Uglow Pope brought the Tirukkuṛaḷ to the western world in 1886.[9] This work is the first translation to the English language. The Tirukkuṛaḷ has been translated to more than 37[10] languages across the world by various authors. – WIKI

We all know that the above mentioned factors are not going to be constant. It’s always better to "plan a little" and move forward. Detailed planning for the complete project won’t help, but that is what many of the managers expects . So that any deviation from the plan will be visible to them and they tend to control it plan by adding resources and many other stuffs which might not work so good.

A better planning strategy is to make detailed plans for the next week, rough plans for the next 3 months, and extremely crude plans beyond that. We should know the individual tasks we will be working on for the next week. We should roughly know the requirements we will be working on for the next 3 months. And we should have only a vague idea what the system will do after a year.      - Agile principles patterns and practices in c#

### From my favorite movie Avengers
*Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack!  
Tony Stark: I have a plan: attack!*

### Take away:
*Don’t plan so much beforehand and try to stick to it, causes and effects are going to be so bad. 
This is the main reason why we moved away from waterfall.*
