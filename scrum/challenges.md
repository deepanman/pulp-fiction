# Challenges

## 1st challenge - Software quality

- One thing and the most important thing, at the end of the sprint is to delivere the high quality/production ready.
- Many times I had seen this is missed and later the issues comes & bites us back.

## 2nd challenge - Commitment

- With my experience this seems to be a challenge when choosing between these priorites
  - Features
  - Schedule
  - Quality
- Which reminds me the areas that influence the Project Success - From Code Complete course in construx
  - First is all about the requirement gathering
  - Second reason project planning
  - Third reason - code quality
- how to choose between features/schedule/quality to deliver a bug free working software is always a constant challenge.

## 3rd challenge - Estimation

Many times, we work on something that is completly new from our past experiences, estimating those and adding to the task board adds lot of pressure.

## 4th challenge - Pressure

The biggest problem with millienials is that , the task board stifles innovation, experimentaion and out of the box
thinking. Task board now has refocussed thoughts on how to get rid of the task in the shortest time possible, the card
on the board is a constant reminder to get it to done bucket

Like how Simon Sinek's says in one of the talk - how the millienials are pulled towards the triggers of dopamine
with the number of post likes and other comments.

## 5th Challenge Motivation factor

### Retrospection

One finest motivation factor which observed is the retrospection meeting.
It lifts the morale of the team.

#### Agenda of the Retrospect meeting

1. Starting with appreciating each and every good work done by the team.
2. Discuss about things that could have done better.
It had a very huge imapact.

Recently read a chapter in "Nine Lies About Work: A Freethinking Leaderâ€™s Guide to the Real World" which was related to feedback. Where the author points that how positive attention improves the productivity of the team.

Which is something I had seen it in my experience. The retrospections did the magic.

But sometimes team feels it as a mundane stuff.
