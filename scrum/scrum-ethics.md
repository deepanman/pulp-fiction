# Scrum Ethics 

This is mostly from the develpers point of view, there could be a consolidated document/checklist , which covers the responsibility of the team , including Scrum Master and Product Owner.

I believe it is a challenging task to put everything together. 

## FORCC

F - Focus
O - Openness
R - Respect
C - Commitment
C - Courage

## Daily Scrum

- Will attend meetings on time, respect the others time and talk with present consciousness,(ie focus on current sprint matters)  
- Will not make up the status, will share the actuals.

## Sprint Planning

- Never assume any of the requirements, discuss in details w.r.t persona
- Never miss even one percent of clarity in the requirement.
- Make sure to understand the vision and mission from the product owner
- Have a clear understanding of goal of the sprint
- Have a good idea on estimation (Software Estimation Demistifying the black art - Steve McConnel) is a great book on estimation

## Sprint

- Will ensure to provide valid commit comments
- Will ensure to follow coding styles, formatters, linters
- Will produce the code with the best of the present knowledge adhering to the design principles
- Most of the times developers maintains the code, it's not always developed from scratch If the code can be improved structurally (refcator)which was missed due to timelines should be addressed in the following sprint.
- Will make sure to produce automated unit test with good amount of code coverage.
- Will spend time to learn in depth
