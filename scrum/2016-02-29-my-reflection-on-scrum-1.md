I am a certified Scrum Master from Scrum Alliance, I have been working on agile based project (Scrum) as a developer,  I now know what developers needs to be productive and to be in a happy bubble . These are not something new , it is just aggregation of my learning from quite a long list of resources like talks of Martin Fowler , Jeff  Sutherland, Jez humble etc.. I am not going to bore you with the same content which is already there in the scrum guide.  Its all about the way I see scrum . Hope everybody enjoys reading it.  

 

We start it right from [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)

1.Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2.Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4.Responding to change over following a plan  

<br>

How can we implement these four core principles , one such a way is *SCRUM*.

# Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

### Co-located:

To me scrum is not a process , its a science . Yes it is very important to have the team co-located, if you are on scrum and your team is distributed then don't call it scrum , give it a different name,  may be Tailored Scrum. What makes me to make it so bold enough is ... (example from the talks of Jez) How many of us have been on phone while driving car? definitely 90% of us would have done it. It shatters the concentration. What matters here is the law.  It’s illegal to ride a motorcycle or drive using hand-held phones or similar devices. If you say I use hands free, there is  a disclaimer "if the police think you’re distracted and not in control of your vehicle you would be stopped and penalized". There is no state that bans talking with your co passengers  , so don't have requirement , design discussion over the phone.Even more worse is the email communication.

Whiteboard ,sticky notes and  markers are the best tools.Collaborate with the team ,draw ,write things on the board , spend time on design discussions with the whole team,give it a enough time ,don't ever be in rush . Creativity costs time. Don't trade creativity for the time. If you are the senior most person in the team then don't think that you are the senior most person in the team , let that ego go off .

### You might want to tell him he's done a good job:

If  you like the idea of your colleague , share it across the teams. Effective communications across the teams is a great challenge , have somebody as a scrum master who is very good at it. From my opinion a scrum master should at least drive more than 1 project . It makes him break the boundaries reach out to the other teams for help for any kind of problems and learn how other teams handles the same problem , that way it makes him a real master.As a scrum master , find ways to appreciate your team daily , they need motivation factor , they need trust factor. Try to brush up on tech side and understand what team is doing . Rather than saying "Can you do this" ,"can you do that" ask them "How can I help you to do this". Make sure you pull them into the happy bubble so you don't have to manage anything, team will do it for you. The team should should appreciate and get feedback from each other continuously.

### 911:

Communication between the team itself should be made easy , so have them co-located , say for example, if you are stuck with an issue and you couldn't proceed for more than 3 hours to 5 hours, then don't forget that there is a 911(of-course your team) . Let the team know that you are stuck , ask for their help, as a team they should just come like a bombing carpenter bees or like fire fighter and solve the issue and go back to their hive. They are not going back until the issue is solved.This relates to the right brain & left brain ways of working, similar to how paired programming works... There are quite lots of researches out there on the same , give it a read. 

### User Story : 3W rule

Most importantly , there's a rule to right user stories. (3W rule). Who,What and Why. A small story , to make it more interesting and why it should be followed.

After finishing the dinner , I went for washing my hands before I left the table, my mom asked me to get a plate, she haven't started with her dinner yet,usually here in India, mom first serves  and once she is sure that everybody is full , then she takes her turn. Within a minute I came with a plate assuming she is yet to eat and she says, "How can I use it to cover the bowl" Okay , the story is over , lets get into the character now.

I know my mom asked the plate(who)
I know what she asked.(a plate)
But I didn't know why she asked , I assumed. It turned out to be wrong.
So keep in mind 3W rule while writing the user story.If a user story didn't satisfy the 3W , please spend more time to polish it.

Few tools are very important for automation, make sure to automate all of the repetitive tasks.Continuous delivery by Jez humble is the best book for it. There are lots and lots of tools which adds real value to the project, few of them ...

- Sonar - Code Quality
- Jenkins - Build Automation
- Code coverage - Jacoco
- Yeoman(yo,bower, grunt )- wonderful tool-set for creating ,developing and packaging the GUI projects. 
- Spring boot
- Jira & Rally are most elegant tools for agile.
- I cannot end this topic without mentioning about the

### Conway's law

organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations[3]

So its very important on how you have organised your teams.Rebuilding micro-services by Sam Newman is a good read.

## Take away :-

*Its not just about breaking down to user stories and daily status calls . If it is so, then that is more likely to be called as micro management.*
