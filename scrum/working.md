# Working software over comprehensive documentation:

*Many of us has this thinking , "I am doing agile , I will not do plans or documents ,etc ...."*

[Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/)

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

*That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.*

If you notice the above two lines in the manifesto ,
it doesn't say there  be no process or no documents or 
no plans.Many doesn't pay attention to these two lines. 
It says to value the items on the left more than the items on the right. 
Its good to value individuals and interactions more than process and tools. 
We should also give attention to the process and tools.

Oh! yes we all know that in scrum we deliver the working software every sprint , also we know the advantages of it. We shall see  how to achieve it .Developers are mostly agile and cross functional. But many times the leadership team wont be cross functional , It is always good to train  the leadership team on the agile ways of working.

## The factors that stands on the way of delivering a working software,(impediments):

- Developers working on more than one projects (context switching).
- Creation of  backlogs being delegated to the developers.
- Waiting for series of approvals for any decisions
- Micro management
- Failure to implement continuous integration
- No vision on the product developed
- No clear roles and responsibilities 
- Rushing through to meet the dead lines
- No time for innovation, creativity.. resulting in spaghetti design/code
- Leadership team always feared/worried about the escalations from the clients.
- Bureaucracy
looks like this list is never going to end,  spent 15 minutes to think about it and I came up with these points .  The whole organisation should work together to remove these impediments. Failure to do so will result is less productivity and poor quality. 

*Jeff - author of scrum , says these things make agile team "FrAgile".*

## Lets see what we can do deliver a working software:

- Good Leadership
- Cross functional leadership & dev teams
- Elegant tools
- Well trained & experienced scrum masters
- Stopping team from multitasking
- Clear and precise definition of done for each and every roles and phases
- Eliminating waste (Muda - wasted effort -   Taiichi Ohno in  The Toyota Production System)     - It is the most important one.                       
- Knowledge sharing across the teams
- Implementing design patterns , Robert C Martin -  author of SOLID principles says polymorphism is the only best way in OO  to design a good software.
- Awards based on team performance 

and many more... looks like even this is going to be a never ending list.

## Eighty Twenty:

We all know that in agile , the working software is the only way to measure the amount of work done, 
say you have followed the 80:20 principle and  completed about 50% of the requirements (high priority ones) 
and as per "working software over comprehensive documentation" this "50% should be ready to go live and add values to the customer,
but in traditional methods even if the team says 75% is done ,
it won't be ready to go live until the rest 25% is done.  
This is how the agile differs from traditional one.

## 5 Why technique:

Create necessary documents :), But how we will know what is necessary ? . 
we cannot have hard and fast rules on what documents needed.It differs from case to case , 
differs across organisation and projects. But what we can do is to try the 5 why technique , 
ask all the stakeholders involved to see if that document is really necessary , 
whether it adds any value and decide based on it. I will add an example for this in the next post.
